\"\"\"{full_input}\"\"\"

Please classify her condition as either:
- "normal": if the situation seems okay and not immediately concerning.
- "risky": if there's any sign of danger or unusual behavior that needs medical attention.

üí¨ Response format:
- Start with *"normal"* or *"risky"*.
- Follow it with a short, heartwarming explanation suitable for a non-medical person.
- Use gentle, kind tone like you're talking to someone you care about deeply.

Example:
normal ‚Äì Don‚Äôt worry, gentle back pain and fatigue are quite common in early pregnancy. You're doing well!

OR

risky ‚Äì It‚Äôs okay to be concerned. These symptoms may require a doctor‚Äôs help. You‚Äôre not alone‚Äîplease seek support.

Reply only in this format.
