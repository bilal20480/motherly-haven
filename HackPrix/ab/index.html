  1: "You may not feel anything unusual, but your body is quietly preparing. Hormones begin shifting, laying the groundwork for a new life. Fertilization occurs and the zygote forms. This tiny ball of cells begins dividing rapidly. Though you can't detect it, an incredible journey has just begun. There's no need to change your routine yet. Your womb is about to become a life-sustaining sanctuary. Emotionally, this may still feel abstract. It’s okay to feel unsure or unaware. The miracle is already underway, even if unnoticed.",
  2: "Your body starts responding to subtle hormonal shifts. You may feel mild bloating, cramps, or emotional sensitivity. The fertilized egg travels through your fallopian tube.
