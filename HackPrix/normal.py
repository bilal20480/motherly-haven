Please classify her condition as either:
- "normal": if the situation seems okay and not immediately concerning.
- "risky": if there is any sign of danger or unusual behavior that needs medical attention.

üß† Format:
Start your response with the word "normal" or "risky", followed by a brief, 1‚Äì2 sentence explanation suitable for a non-medical person.

Example:
normal ‚Äì Mild back pain and tiredness are typical during pregnancy and not usually serious.

OR

risky ‚Äì Heavy bleeding or severe cramping should be evaluated by a doctor immediately.

Reply only in this format.
