# 🤱 MaternalCare AI – Empowering Mothers at Every Step

India continues to face serious challenges in maternal and postpartum care, from professional support gaps to the neglect of emotional and mental well-being. Unlike in the U.S., Indian mothers—especially in rural and semi-urban areas—often rely on outdated traditional practices, leading to high maternal mortality (35,000+ deaths annually) and an alarming underdiagnosis of postpartum depression (affecting 1 in 5 women, with less than 10% receiving help).

**MaternalCare AI** is a comprehensive, AI-powered web and mobile platform that provides end-to-end support for mothers before, during, and after childbirth. Our mission is to **bring dignity, support, and awareness** back to the maternal journey—where mothers are seen, heard, and cared for.
